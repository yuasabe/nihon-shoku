<h2>Prologue</h2>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
<p>Though we have already expressed about development of technology for communication in the concerned chapter, "Progress of technique of communication", such a progress has made development of the way to associate among people.</p>
<p>Since telephone had invented in modern times, we became to be able to communicate each other even if we are in far, and the world started to follow the way which leads to internationalization. We can say they are good examples: development of Internet and television telephone.</p>
<p>In such the climate, there are techniques that existed once or are used even in the present day and have been taken in by Internet.</p>
<p>There was once message board in Japanese station. We used to write, say, "(I wrote this) in 4 o'clock: I am waiting for Mr. John Smith in the caf? 'Amazon'," and it is erased by the staff of station in the after few hours.</p>
<p>There is billboard, is the system which stays even now. Somebody notifies a poster and many people see it. People can ignore it and also can watch it with interest.</p>
<p>I think former is difficult to use by the protection of personal information but latter is one of ways to tell information that we can see even now.</p>
<p>And also, there is still way to talk by sentences. I think there is somebody who has ever talked with your friends by handing a piece of paper in a time of class. I also think they were more informal exchanges of sentences than letters. At now, we can do it without circumstance in the whole world.</p>
<p>On the Internet, we can use "BBS" billboard or message board. And also, we can use "chat" to exchange a few sentences informally among the whole world.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, there are some people that use these convenient systems for something bad.</p>
<p>So we will express 3 things in this chapter: about "BBS", "chat" and people doing something bad on the Internet.</p>
