<p>Although we expressed about development of technology for communication, in the part of software, we can say that "Graphical User Interface" has played a big part in progress of computer.</p>
<p>User interface means the shape of exchange between user and computer device. It can be grouped into two types, "Character User Interface (CUI)" and Graphical User Interface (GUI)".</p>
<p>At first, I will describe about CUI. CUI is form of exchange by inputting of letters from keyboard and outputting of letters. It's what called "console". This is the form that can be seen even in the early age of computer because CUI can be worked on low-specifications and low-price computer lightly in the age that high-specifications computers were so expensive. (As CUI is exchange of letter; though there was point that the language and technique were still in developing.) It was also used in OS. MS-DOS (Microsoft Corporation) and old-type OS built in <a title="UNIX: &#13;the system made by AT&T with C-language; Many system were made with this (ex. Linux)." class="word">UNIX</a> System were made up of this system, CUI.</p>
<p>Generally, it is said that CUI has already gone out of use. But today, that the high-specifications computer which can be made intensive use has become inexpensive, sometimes we use it in executing OS and some program. The example is "Command Prompt" of Windows. Also, it is used in making of the computer program.</p>
<p>Now, I will express about GUI. Compared to CUI, GUI uses graphics heavily to display information. Also, in inputting, pointing device like mouse and trackball is used.</p>

<p>This form of operation is used by general user of computer today. There are OS that using this system, for example, Windows (by Microsoft Corporation) and Macintosh (by Apple Inc.).</p>
<p>There are some reasons why it became to be used by non-advanced users, compared to CUI, which had already been popular for programmers.</p>
<p>The first point is that computer which can use GUI adequately became to be able to be supplied in the process of computer's develop. In 1970s and 80s, an extent of the computer's specification was to display and calculate only hexadecimal because the technique of hardware was still undeveloped. Also, programming by advanced language doesn't go well. (In programming, they used <a title="machine language: &#13;the language which machine can understand directly; It's made up of 0 and 1." class="word">machine language</a>.) Therefore, it was so difficult to spread except computers for military affairs by state budget and ones in large facilities for study.</p>
<p>But, by the breakthrough of hardware's technique, CPU, memory and hard disk became to be able to stand using GUI. Then anyone became to be able to operate personal computer easily with only one mouse.</p>
<p>The second point is that GUI, which can be used with only one mouse and use graphics heavily, attracts beginners of computer, compared to CUI, which made up of only letters and users have to remember many particular commands.</p>
<p>Now, I will describe the difference of operation between MS-DOS (CUI) and Windows (GUI) in one example.</p>
<p>Then, I will move the text file in Drive A (ThinkQuest.txt) to the directory in same drive (ThinkQuest). At this time, on Windows (GUI), what you have to do is to drag and drop to directory. But on MS-DOS (CUI),</p>
<p>MOVE A:\ThinkQuest.txt A:\ThinkQuest\</p>
<p>you have to input the command like above by keyboard. Operation of DOS is not easy for beginners. But, on OS (GUI), you can move files only one click. </p>
<p>I think the above is the reason why computer using GUI and OS became popular.</p>
