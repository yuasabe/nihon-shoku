<h2>About blog-Twitter</h2>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
<p>Have you ever written diary? Today, you can write diary on the computer! Though there is software to write diary in computer, we'll leave out about such systems. Then, we will introduce about systems to write diary on the Internet and show it to users of Internet.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard this on the news? It's "blog".</p>
<p>Originally the word "blog" comes from "Weblog", LOG on the WEB.</p>
<p>As we expressed before, its part is very simple: to write diary on the Internet and show it to users of Internet. Basically, we register in site which manages blog and write it on the site. Each contributions calls "entry", and are enrolled date and time. Their content is sentence (of course), picture, picture writing (some sites), etc. Viewers can submit feelings in each entry. (Writers and viewers can choose to show everyone their contributions or not.)</p>
<p>In Japan, there is argument whether politician's use is campaign or not. In Upper House election on 2005, it was considered as campaign and using blog in election period by politician was banned by Japanese Public Offices Election Law.</p>
<p>Now, I think there is somebody who thought "Oh, this is troublesome system..." The system made to cancel complicated thing is "Twitter".</p>
<p>"Twitter" is the system founded by Obvious Corporation (Twitter Inc. at present) in 2006. Users have their own page and submit sentences called "Tweet" in 140 words. Then the submission is recorded with date and time. Other users can access the user's page and answer to it as "Reply". How to use "Reply" is only to set "@" and user's name before "Tweet" (ex. @John_Smith: How wonderful!). The submission of "Reply" can be seen in both users' pages.</p>
<p>Also, one of the biggest functions of Twitter is "Follow". This is what to mark users if you found pleased users. And you can watch the users' submission in your user's page without accessing to the users' pages. People who are following are called "Follower".</p>
<p>By the way, in opinion of Japanese government, Twitter is treated as one of the campaigns. So using twitter in election period by politician is banned in Japan.</p>
<p>Twitter can be used easier than blog. (It is other argument whether Twitter is diary or not.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is case someone write blog and Twitter pretend to be celebrity. In Twitter, you can search users with its function. Usually some celebrities' names are found in search. Of course sometimes they are original, but in the other hand, they are not ones. In Twitter, there is the system of "Verified Accounts". This system is to manage accounts which verified as user is original by administration.</p>
