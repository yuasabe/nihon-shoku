<h2>About movie site</h2>
<div style="text-indent:2em">
<p>I think there are some families taking home videos. The videos (most of them may be children's growth record) are usually kept as treasures. Now, the videos are only to family, but in world of information technology, such videos (not necessarily home videos) can be transmitted to whole world. It is video sites.</p>
<p>In such sites, users register to the site and submit users' own video. Other users can watch the videos. (Submitting movies are usually needed to register. But in watching, there are sites which need to register and which don't.) There are some sites that users can limit movies to be watched and allow watching only users belong to particular communities.</p>
<p>To watch movies generally, sites adopt the system "<a title="streaming: &#13;the system to save movie along watching; By this system, you can watch the movies rapidly on and after second time because computer doesn't have to download the movie from video sites again." class="word">Streaming</a>", and on and after 2nd time watching of the video can do rapidly.</p>
<p>But there is some problem. At first, in sites which users aren't needed to register, even if there are posts of videos that is not appropriate to children, they can watch it freely. In such case, users report to manager of site and manager deletes or admits watching only to registered non-minor users, are done. (But what we have to do is only fill wrong age in registration, so it is not problem of registered or not.)</p>
<p>Next, there is problem of copyright. There are some cases that users upload recorded TV program, their music from bought CD, etc. Especially music is to be difficult to find because music is worked in movies. The measure is to put signal to video in TV program and music in CD. By this signal, we become not to be able to change <a title="extension: &#13;the sign of letter in the end of files (e.g. '.txt', '.exe')">extension</a> (About extension, we expressed in chapter "Progress of program".) or such videos can be found easily.</p>
<p>We expressed about problem of video site above. Anyway, some companies compete in market to see users of such video sites as new business opportunity. This is attracted new industry. Why don't you use it in this chance?</p>
